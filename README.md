## Features

### project structure

> you may import net sevice from the `reques.js` file directly

```
|———— node_modules
|———— src
|    |———— index.html
|    |———— main.js  (entry point)
|    |———— request.js
|———— package.json
|———— package-lock.json
|———— webpack.config.js
|———— tsconfig.json (when using typescript)
```

With pre-installed templates, it's convinient to start development and build for production.

### out-of-box tools

- Optional TypeScript (highly recommended)
- Webpack and useful loaders/plugins (no worry about choosing thoes confusing loaders/plugins ever since)
- Babel (always ❤ with mordern JavaScript)
- Axios (easy to send request)
- Eslint 
  
The Webpack will use `main.js` as the entry point, also you can change it inside the config file, and with the help of Webpack plugins there's no need to import it in `index.html` using `script` tag.
